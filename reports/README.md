# Reports

Reports are files generated by the `fit-simulated-measurements.py` script. They contain the 
average fitted concentration and its standard deviation for the fittings performed on a set of
simulated measurements for different configurations of the dual comb, varying the number of teeth
and the tooth spacing. Here are the parameters used to generate some of these reports:

These were a set of simulations performed for the 3427.4 nm methane (CH4) line, at 298 K, 
and 53328.95 Pa (400 Torr), with a volume mixing ratio of 0.01. The parameters used were:
